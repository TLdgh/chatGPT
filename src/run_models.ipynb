A lattice L is coordinatizable, if it is isomorphic to the lattice L(R)\nof principal right ideals of some von Neumann regular ring R. This forces L\nto be complemented modular.

Fur-\nthermore, the class of coordinatizable lattices is not closed under countable\ndirected unions; this solves another problem of B. Jénsson from 1962.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nA coordinatization theorem is a statement that expresses a class of geometric\nobjects in algebraic terms. Hence it is a path from synthetic geometry to analytic\ngeometry. While the former includes lattice theory, as, for example, abundantly\nillustrated in M.K. Bennett’s survey paper [2], the latter is more often written\nin the language of rings and modules. Nevertheless the concepts of analytic and\nsynthetic geometry will not let themselves be captured so easily. For example, the\nmain result of E. Hrushovski and B. Zilber [13, Theorem A] may certainly be viewed\nas a coordinatization theorem, with geometric objects of topological nature.\n\nIt should be no surprise that coordinatization theorems are usually very difficult\nresults. The classical coordinatization theorem of Arguesian affine planes (as, for\nexample, presented in E. Artin [1, Chapitre II]) was extended over the last century\nto a huge work on modular lattices, which also brought surprising and deep con-\nnections with coordinatization results in universal algebra, see the survey paper by\nC. Herrmann [11]. We cite the following milestone, due to J. von Neumann [24].\n\nVon Neumann’s Coordinatization Theorem. If a complemented modular lat-\ntice L has a spanning finite homogeneous sequence with at least four elements,\nthen L is coordinatizable, that is, there exists a von Neumann regular ring R such\nthat L is isomorphic to the lattice L(R) of all principal right ideals of R.\n\nWe refer the reader to Sections 2—4 for precise definitions. We observe that\nwhile the statement that a lattice is coordinatizable is, apparently, “complicated”\n(it begins with an existential quantifier over regular rings), von Neumann’s suffi-\ncient condition is logically simple—for example, having a spanning homogeneous\nsequence with four elements is a first-order condition.\n\nDate: November 8, 2018.\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 06C20, 06C05, 03C20, 16E50.\n\nKey words and phrases.

This is an expository paper in which I explain how core math-\nematics, particularly abstract analysis, can be developed within a concrete\ncountable set Jz (the second set in Jensen’s constructible hierarchy). The im-\nplication, well-known to proof theorists but probably not to most mainstream\nmathematicians, is that ordinary mathematical practice does not require an\nenigmatic metaphysical universe of sets. I go further and argue that J2 is a\nsuperior setting for normal mathematics because it is free of irrelevant set-\ntheoretic pathologies and permits stronger formulations of existence results.\n\nPerhaps many mathematicians would admit to harboring some feelings of dis-\ncomfort about the ethereal quality of Cantorian set theory. Yet draconian alter-\nnatives such as intuitionism, which holds that simple number-theoretic statements\nlike the twin primes conjecture may have no definite truth value, probably violate\nthe typical working mathematician’s intuition far more severely than any vague\nunease he may feel about remote cardinals such as, say, Xx,,.\n\nI believe that ordinary mathematical practice is actually most compatible with\nan intermediate foundational stance I call conceptualism. This is a modernized\nversion of the predicativist philosophy originally formulated by Henri Poincaré and\nBertrand Russell, which treats elementary number theory from an essentially pla-\ntonic point of view but in the realm of set theory admits only those sets that can be\nconstructed in a very concrete way. One consequence of this restriction is that on\nthe conceptualist account all sets are countable. While this would seem to render\nthe bulk of ordinary mathematics illegitimate, work begun by Hermann Weyl and\ncontinued by many others has gradually shown that in fact most if not all core\nmathematics can be developed within surprisingly minimalist systems. This point\nhas been emphasized in [3]. However, early work of this type tended to be presented\nin a somewhat abstruse or idiosyncratic way, while more recent work is generally\ncouched in axiomatic frameworks that mainstream mathematicians might find un-\nintuitive. The goal of this paper is to show how to develop core mathematics in a\nconcrete countable domain called Jz which should be relatively easily appreciated\nby mainstream mathematicians with no special training in logic. (The first two\nsections of the paper are probably the main hurdle; however, they might not need\nto be read in detail before proceeding to later sections.) Our central novelty is not\nany major technical advance but rather the choice of an approach that is closer\nin spirit to the classical style, and hence, perhaps, a more congenial environment\nfor doing normal mathematics than one finds in previous work of this type (e.g.,\n(1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15]). Since a really thorough exposition could fill several\nvolumes I have chosen to present the foundational material at a fairly high level\nof detail, followed by a moderately detailed treatement of basic real analysis and\n\nsuccessively more synoptic treatments of more advanced topics.

Building on Retakh’s approach to Ext groups through categories\nof extensions, Schwede reobtained the well-known Gerstenhaber algebra struc-\nture on Ext groups over bimodules of associative algebras both from splicing\nextensions (leading to the cup product) and from a suitable loop in the cat-\negories of extensions (leading to the Lie bracket).

Nowadays, syzygies are of general\nimportance in algebraic geometry, homology algebra and representation theory of groups\nand algebras etc.. The advantage of syzygies is that they contain important information\nof modules and they can test some homological dimensions. For instance, Zimmermann-\nHuisgen and her coauthors showed that the structure of syzygies is important and powerful\nin understanding and compute various finitistic dimension of some algebras such as string\nalgebras, monomial algebras and serial algebras [4, 20, 21, 22].\n\nMonomial algebras and serial algebras are all syzygy-finite. By definition, syzygy-finite\nalgebras means that there is an integer s such that the class of all n-th syzygies, where\nn > s, is representation finite, or equivalently, the number of non-isomorphic indecompos-\nable modules in the class is finite. Syzygy-finite algebras have nice homological properties.\nThey satisfy a group of homological conjectures related to the finitistic dimension con-\njecture, for instance, Auslander conjecture (c.f. [5]) and Auslander-Reiten conjecture [1]\netc.. Recently, algebras of finite Cohen-Macaulay type, or CM-finite algebras, are more\nattractive, see for instance [11] and references therein.

Our commutator convention is [71,72] := V1727,'72-- The symbol\ndist(-,-) denotes the (ordinary) distance between two subsets of a metric space.\n\n1.1. Introduction: what is “superintrinsic synthesis”? The main object in\nthis paper is fixed point property with respect to (isometric) actions.\n\nDefinition 1.1 (Fixed point property).

We say that G has property (Fy) if G > G has relative\nproperty (Fy).\n\nRecall that G is assumed to be finitely generated. For relative properties, we only\nrequire that groups are countable.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe index theorem states that every continuous f: T — T is homotopic to\nthe function t + ¢” for some n € Z (its winding number). As a consequence the\nquotient of the unitary group of C*(Z) by its connected component is isomorphic to\nZ. This identification can be extended in a functorial fashion to finitely generated\nAbelian groups and their inductive limits. Since every torsion-free Abelian group\nis an inductive limit of finitely generated groups, the following theorem, that we\ntake as the departing point of our paper, follows.\n\nTheorem 1.1 (see Theorem 8.57 of [10]). If T is a torsion-free Abelian group\nthe quotient U/Uo of the unitary group U = U(C*(LT)) by its connected component\nUp is isomorphic to T. Hence, two torsion-free Abelian groups T, and T2 with\ntopologically isomorphic unitary groups U(C*(T1)) and U(C*(L'2)) must already be\nisomorphic.\n\nTheorem 1.1 suggests the usage of U(C*(T)) as an invariant for C*([). To\ndetermine its strength it is necessary to know to what extent the topological group\nstructure of /(C*([)) determines C*([). As a first step in this direction, we devote\nSection 4 to characterize when two Abelian groups Ty and Tz have isomorphic\nunitary groups. The groups U/(C*(IT'1)) and U/(C* (f'2)) are shown to be topologically\nisomorphic if and only if |[,/t(T1)| = |[2/t(T2)| =: a and @11/t(T1) is group-\nisomorphic to 6,1 2/t(l'2), where ¢(';) stands for the torsion subgroup of I.\n\nAnother unitary-related invariant of C*(I) of great importance is the K,-group,\nK,(C*(L)).

INTRODUCTION\n\nK.S.S. Nambooripad passed away in his home in Trivandrum, India on January 4, 2020.\nHe was an outstanding mathematician and the founder of an important school of semi-\ngroup theory in the Indian state of Kerala. Some information about his work may be\nfound in the tribute [82] that the first and third authors of this article wrote on the occasion\nof Nambooripad’s 80th birthday in 2015. Some interesting additional information about\nNambooripad’s life and his impact on the development of the TEX software package in\nIndia may be found in Radhakrishnan’s blog [110]. In the present article, we summarize\nsome of his mathematical work and its impact on the development of semigroup theory.\n\nNambooripad’s most influential work was primarily concerned with the study of (von\nNeumann) regular semigroups and their connections with other fields of mathematics, and\nthis article will focus on some of his contributions in this area. He made seminal contri-\nbutions to the study of regular semigroups through his two deep works [86] and [88]. The\nfirst of these develops a structure theory of regular semigroups via his notions of biordered\nsets and inductive groupoids, while the second studies regular semigroups via his theory\nof normal categories and cross connections. Both works have had a major impact on our\nunderstanding of regular semigroups and on the development of much subsequent and on-\ngoing work in the field.\n\nWe will assume that the reader is familiar with the basic ideas and notation of semigroup\ntheory, as presented in the books of Clifford and Preston [20] or Howie [57]. We will also\nmake use of the basic notions of category theory as presented in the books by MacLane [73]\nor Higgins [56]. If @ is a category, then we will use v@ to denote the set of vertices\n(objects) of the category @ and we will denote the set of morphisms in @ from v to w by\n€(v,w). For most categories we will denote the composition of a morphism f € @(v,w)\nand g € @(w,z) by fg, but this will be denoted by gf in the section on Fredholm operators\nin Section 6 of the paper.\n\nSection 2 of this paper is based on Nambooripad’s memoir [86]. It outlines his concept\nof biordered sets and inductive groupoids and their role in the structure theory of regular\nsemigroups. In Section 3, we discuss some of the outgrowths of Nambooripad’s inductive\ngroupoid approach to the structure of regular semigroups and its impact on subsequent\nand ongoing work in the field. In particular, we discuss his concept of the natural partial\n\n1",

In the course, we develop the formalism of canonical vector spaces,\nwhich enables us to realize the group AMp(V) and the representation p in a\ntransparent manner.\n\n0. INTRODUCTION\n\nIn his celebrated 1964 Acta paper [6] André Weil constructed a distinguished\nunitary representation py, Which is associated with a symplectic vector space\n(V,w) over a local field F, now referred to as the Weil representation. The Weil\nrepresentation has many fascinating properties which have gradually been brought\nto light over the last few decades. It now appears that this representation is a central\nobject in mathematics: Lying at the fabric of the theory of harmonic analysis and\nbridging between various topics in mathematics and physics, including classical\ninvariant theory, the theory of theta functions and automorphic forms and last\n(but probably not least) quantum mechanics.\n\nIn his paper, André Weil constructs pw, first, in the setup when F is a local\nfield of characteristic zero or a local field of finite characteristic p where p 4 2. In\nthis case, Pye is a representation of a double cover of the symplectic group S'p (V)\n(called the metaplectic cover). Then, he proceeds [2, 6] to construct pyy,i in the\nmore intricate setup when F is a local field of characteristic 2. In this case, py; is\na representation of a double cover of the pseudo-symplectic group Ps (V), which is\na non-trivial gluing of an orthogonal group and the dual vector space V%, i.e., we\nhave a short exact sequence of groups\n\n1> V* > Ps(V) > O(Q) > 1,\n\nwhere, Q : V > F is the quadratic form Q(v) = 8(v,v) for some non-symmetric\nbilinear form 8: V x V > F such that 8 (v,u) — 6 (u,v) =w(v,u), and O(Q) is\nthe associated orthogonal group.\n\nA comparison between the constructions in the two setups suggests that the\ndefinition of py when F is a field of characteristic 2 is unsatisfactory for the\nreason that the pseudo-symplectic group is not related anymore to the symplectic\n\nDate: March 24, 2008.\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Homotopy group representation 37\nReferences 39\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAn operad is an algebraic device which encodes operations with multiple inputs acting on categories\nof algebras like associative algebras, Lie algebras, commutative algebras, etc. They are used to govern\nthe relations and the symmetries of these operations. The two main breakthroughs of operad theory are\nthe theory of /,.-operads and the Koszul duality theory. On the one hand, the notion of an E..-operad\nemerged from the theory of iterated loop spaces [May72, BV73]. An algebra over an E.-operad, called\nan £..-algebra, is a generalization of the notion of commutative algebra where everything is relaxed up to\nhomotopy, that is both the associativity relation and the symmetry of the product. Such a rich algebraic\nstructure is present on the level of the singular cochain complex of a topological space [Man06] and this\ncreates enough algebraic invariants to faithfully detect its homotopy type. On the other hand, the Koszul\nduality theory [GK94, GJ94] provides us with many tools to work out the homological algebra of operads\nand hence the homotopy theory of algebras over operads. Applied to the operad encoding associative\nalgebras, it gives the notion of an A,,-algebra, related to loop spaces, due to J. Stasheff [Sta63] and the\nbar construction of Eilenberg—MacLane [EML53]. Applied to the operad encoding Lie algebras, it gives\nthe notion of an L..-algebra which plays a crucial role in deformation theory [Kon03, Get09] and the\nChevalley—Eilenberg complex [CE48]. Applied to the operad encoding commutative algebras, it gives the\nnotion of a C’..-algebra, present in rational homotopy theory [Qui69, Sul77], and the Harrison complex\n[Har62]. So it works well in general in characteristic 0, but sometimes fails to apply outside that case. For\ninstance, a C'.-algebra is an F.,-algebra only in characteristic 0, precisely because the symmetry of te\nproduct is not relaxed up to homotopy.\n\nDate: March 11, 2015.\n\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The notion of an operad was created in order to have a well defined mathematical object\nwhich encodes “operations”. Its name is a porte-manteau word, coming from the contraction of the words\n“operations” and “monad”’, because an operad can be defined as a monad encoding operations. The intro-\nduction of this notion was prompted in the 60’s, by the necessity of working with higher operations made\nup of higher homotopies appearing in algebraic topology.\n\nAlgebra is the study of algebraic structures with respect to isomorphisms. Given two isomorphic vector\nspaces and one algebra structure on one of them, one can always define, by means of transfer, an algebra\nstructure on the other space such that these two algebra structures become isomorphic.\n\nHomotopical algebra is the study of algebraic structures with respect to quasi-isomorphisms, i.e. mor-\nphisms of chain complexes which induce isomorphisms in homology only. The main difference with the\nprevious situation is that quasi-isomorphisms of chain complexes are not invertible in general. However,\ngiven two quasi-isomorphic chain complexes and one algebra structure on one of them, one can always\ndefine, on the other chain complex, an algebra structure. But, in this case, the relations are satisfied only\nup to homotopy. In the end, these two algebra structures become quasi-isomorphic in some way. This last\nresult is called the Homotopy Transfer Theorem, or HTT for short.\n\nIn the first cases like associative algebras, commutative algebras, and Lie algebras, this kind of result can\nbe proved by hand. However, in general, the transferred algebra structure yields a coherent system of\nhigher homotopies, whose complexity increases quickly with the number of the initial operations. Using\noperad theory, for instance Koszul duality theory, one can prove the HTT with explicit formulae. In this\nway, one recovers, and thus unifies, many classical objects appearing in Algebra, Geometry, Topology and,\nMathematical Physics like spectral sequences, Massey products, or Feynman diagrams, for instance.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nRecall that a Poisson structure on a commutative algebra A is a Lie bracket {-,-}: Ax AA\nsatisfying the Leibniz rule {a, bc} = b{a,c} + {a,b}c for all a, b, c € A. For noncommutative algebras,\nthis definition is known to be too restrictive: if A is a noncommutative domain (more generally, a prime\nring), any Poisson bracket on A is a multiple of the commutator [a, b] = ab — ba (see [FL], Theorem 1.2).\nMotivated by recent work on noncommutative geometry (see [Ko, G, BL, CBEG, VdB]), Crawley-Boevey\nproposed in [CB] a different notion of the Poisson structure on an algebra A that agrees with the above\ndefinition for commutative algebras and has surprisingly nice categorical properties. The idea of [CB]\nwas to find the weakest structure on A that induces natural Poisson structures on the moduli spaces of\nfinite-dimensional semisimple representations of A. It turns out that such a weak Poisson structure is\ngiven by a Lie bracket on the 0-th cyclic homology HCo(A) = A/[A, A] satisfying some extra conditions;\nit is thus called in [CB] an Hp-Poisson structure. The very terminology of [CB] suggests that there might\nexist a ‘higher’ homological generalization of this construction. The aim of this paper is to show that\nthis is indeed the case: our main construction yields a graded (super) Lie algebra structure on the full\ncyclic homology of A:\n\n{-,-}: HC.(A) x HC,(A) > HC, (A)\nthat satisfies certain properties and restricts to Crawley-Boevey’s Ho-Poisson structure on HCo(A). We\ncall such structures the derived Poisson structures on A.\n\nTo explain our results in more detail we first recall the main theorem of [CB]. Let A be an associative\nunital algebra and let V be a finite-dimensional vector space, both defined over a field & of characteristic\nzero. The classical representation scheme parametrizing the k-linear representations of A in V can be\ndefined as the functor on the category of commutative algebras\n\n(1) Repy(A): CommAlg, > Sets, Bro Homaig, (A, B®, EndV) .\n\nIt is well known that (1) is representable, and we denote the corresponding commutative algebra by\nk[Repy(A)]. The group GL(V) acts naturally on the scheme Rep; (A), with orbits corresponding to the\nisomorphism classes of representations. The closed orbits correspond to the classes of semisimple represen-\n\ntations and are parametrized by the affine quotient scheme Repy(A)//GL(V) = Spec k[Repy (A)]|S&™)\n(see, e.g., [K]). Now, there is a natural trace map\n\n(2) Try : HCo(A) > k[Repy (A)]SL™)\n\ndefined by taking the characters of representations. In terms of (2), we can state the main result of [CB]\nas follows.\n\nTheorem 1 ([CB], Theorem 1.6). Given an Ho-Poisson structure on A, for each V, there exists a unique\nPoisson structure on Repy(A)//GL(V) satisfying\n\n{Try (a), Trv(b)} = Try ({a, b}) , Va,b © HCo(A) .\n\nOur generalization of Theorem 1 is based on results of the recent paper [BKR], where the character\nmap (2) is extended to higher cyclic homology. We briefly review these results referring the reader\nto [BKR] (and Section 2 below) for details. Varying A (while keeping V fixed) one can regard the\nrepresentation functor (1) as a functor on the category Alg, of algebras. This functor can then extended\n\n1",

As an application\nwe give a new construction of the functor that assigns to a groupoid its groupoid C*-algebra\nand thereby its topological K-theory spectrum.\n\nLet (C,w,cC) be a cofibration category, i.e. a structure dual to a category of fibrant objects\nin the sense of Brown [Bro73].

Similarly, wc@ will denote the subcategory of acyclic cofibrations.\nIn addition to Brown’s axioms, we will assume that © has good cylinders which is a mild technical\ncondition explained in Definition 9.

The same universal property in the world\nof ordinary categories describes C[w~']. By passing to opposite categories, the dual statement of\nTheorem 1 for fibration categories also holds.\n\nThe proof of Theorem 1 will be given at the end of the paper, but let us first establish a\nconsequence and the application to C*-algebras associated to groupoids.\n\nLet € be a small cofibration category with good cylinders and M a model category which is\nQuillen equivalent to a combinatorial model category and has functorial fibrant and cofibrant\nreplacements, e.g. any of the model categories of spectra.\n\nProposition 2.

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the first week of May, 1953, a conference on fiber bundles and differential geometry was held\nat Cornell University. A brief report about that conference, written by N. E. Steenrod, appeared\nin [St53], where the final two sentences read:\n\nThe discussions were marked by the presentations of numerous unsolved problems.\nThese were recorded and a report on them is being prepared for publication.\n\nThe young postdoc given the task of collecting the problems was F. Hirzebruch, who was then\nnearing the end of the first year of his two-year stay at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS)\nin Princeton. For him, the most important open problem was what he thought of as the high-\ndimensional Riemann-Roch problem. A few weeks after the Cornell conference, Hirzebruch\nproved the signature theorem, and, by the end of 1953, he had deduced from it what we now\ncall the Hirzebruch-Riemann—Roch theorem.\n\nBy the end of March, 1954, when Hirzebruch submitted the collection of problems for publi-\ncation, he had replaced the Riemann—Roch problem by several other problems that arose out of\nhis work on the signature and Riemann—Roch theorems. The published collection [Hi54] was\nreviewed in Mathematical Reviews by S. Chern, who wrote [Ch55]:\n\nThe paper lists a set of 34 unsolved problems of current interest concerned with\ndifferentiable, almost complex, and complex manifolds. The problems are expertly\nchosen; their clarification and partial or complete solutions will probably take\nmany years and will certainly mean progress of the field. In stating the problems,\nthe author tries to give their motivation, their relations to known results, and re-\nlated facts. In this sense the paper is at the same time a resumé and exposition of\nthe subject, or at least of a major part of it.\n\nChern’s description was certainly prescient. Reading Hirzebruch’s paper [Hi54] now, 60 years\nafter is was written, one cannot help noticing how modern the paper was, and how, even now,\n\nDate: May 19, 2013; © D.

Specifically we show that U-\nbases of locally compact sober spaces are dual to <-distributive V-predomains,\nwhere ~ is a transitive relation representing compact containment.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHistorical Background. Over 80 years ago in [Sto36], Stone exhibited a re-\nmarkable duality between Boolean algebras and clopen bases of compact Hausdorff\nspaces, one which inspired a whole host of dualities between algebraic and more an-\nalytic structures. Even the specific duality that Stone examined would be extended\nseveral times in the ensuing decades. The first step was taken by Stone himself in\nSto38], where he extended to the duality from Boolean algebras to general distribu-\ntive lattices, and from clopen bases of compact Hausdorff spaces to compact open\nbases of locally compact sober spaces that are coherent. It was only much later in\nGra78, II.5] that coherence was eliminated by Gratzer, the key idea being to work\nwith V-semilattices satisfying an appropriate generalisation of distributivity.\nAround the same time, Hofmann and Lawson obtained a duality for general\nlocally compact sober spaces in [HL78], but at the cost of dealing with big lattices,\nnamely continuous frames representing the entire open set lattice. It was only much\nlater again in [JS96], building on ideas from [Smy92], that a partial unification of\nthe Hofmann-Lawson and Stone dualities was achieved. However, there were still\na couple of issues, e.g. Jung-Siinderhauf’s work was again restricted to coherent\nspaces. Also, their axioms were too strong to apply to the entire open set lattice,\nand even finding an appropriate basis to satisfy their axioms turned out to be a\nnon-trivial task.\n\nNevertheless, the basic idea of [JS96] was perfectly sound, namely to work with\na lattice, or better yet a V-semilattice, together with an extra transitive relation\n~< representing compact containment. However, instead of imposing proximity-like\nconditions on <, we take leaf out of Gratzer’s book and formulate an even more\ngeneral notion of distributivity for <~. The theory then proceeds more smoothly\nalong classical lines (e.g. extending the Birkhoff-Stone prime filter theorem to ~x),\nallowing us to simultaneously generalise and hence unify all these Stone duality\nextensions. Moreover, we make the duality functorial via certain relational mor-\n\nphisms, just like in [JS96] and [BS19a].\n\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 06A12, 06D50, 06E15, 54D10, 54D45, 54D70, 54D80.\n\nKey words and phrases.

We provide a direct and elementary proof of the fact that the category of Nachbin’s compact\nordered spaces is dually equivalent to an Ni-ary variety of algebras. Further, we show that Ni is a sharp\nbound: compact ordered spaces are not dually equivalent to any SP-class of finitary algebras.\n\nIn 1936, in his landmark paper [21], M. H. Stone described what is nowadays known as Stone duality for\nBoolean algebras. In modern terms, it states that the category of Boolean algebras with homomorphisms is\ndually equivalent to the category of totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces with continuous maps. If\nwe drop the assumption of total disconnectedness, we are left with the category KH of compact Hausdorff\nspaces and continuous maps. Duskin showed in 1969 that the opposite category KH°? — which, by Gelfand-\nNaimark duality [10], can be identified with the category of commutative unital C*-algebras — is monadic\nover the category of sets and functions [8, 5.15.3]. In fact, KH®°? is equivalent to a variety of algebras. Although\nnot finitary, this is an N,-ary variety. That is, it can be described by operations of at most countably infinite\narity. A generating set of operations was exhibited by Isbell [13], while a finite axiomatisation of this variety\nwas provided in [16]. Therefore, if we allow for infinitary operations, Stone duality for Boolean algebras can\nbe lifted to compact Hausdorff spaces, retaining the algebraic nature.\n\nShortly after his paper on the duality for Boolean algebras, Stone published a generalisation of this theory\nto distributive lattices [23]. In his formulation, the dual category consists of the nowadays called spectral\nspaces and perfect maps. While spectral spaces are in general not Hausdorff, H. A. Priestley showed in\n1970 that they can be equivalently described as certain compact Hausdorff spaces equipped with a partial\norder relation [19]. More precisely, Priestley duality states that the category of (bounded) distributive\nlattices is dually equivalent to the full subcategory of Nachbin’s compact ordered spaces on the totally order-\ndisconnected objects (cf. Definitions 3 and 19). As with Boolean algebras, one may ask if Priestley duality\ncan be lifted to the category KH< of compact ordered spaces while retaining its algebraic nature. In [12],\nthe authors showed that KH? is equivalent to an Nj-ary quasi-variety and partially described its algebraic\ntheory. In the recent work [1], the first-named author proved that KHZ is in fact equivalent to an Ny-ary\nvariety, by providing an equational axiomatisation. The result is rather involved, and is based on an algebraic\nlanguage whose finitary reduct extends the positive part of the language of MV-algebras [7].\n\nIn this note we provide a new proof of the fact that KH? is equivalent to an N-ary variety, which relies only\n\non properties of Nachbin’s compact ordered spaces. The structure of our proof is the following. A well-known\nresult in category theory, recalled in Section 1, characterises those categories which are equivalent to some\nvariety of possibly infinitary algebras. A key property, which distinguishes varieties among quasi-varieties,\nis the effectiveness of (internal) equivalence relations. In Section 2 we recall some basic facts about compact\nordered spaces. Further, we state Theorem 8, asserting that equivalence relations in KH? are effective, and\nshow that it implies that KH is equivalent to an Nj-ary variety. Sections 3—4 contain the proof of Theorem 8.\nFirst, we characterise equivalence relations on a compact ordered space X, in the category KH2’, as certain\npre-orders on the order-topological coproduct X + X. Then, we rephrase effectiveness into an order-theoretic\ncondition and show that it is satisfied by every pre-order arising from an equivalence relation. Finally, in\nSection 5, we show that the bound Xj is best possible: KHg is not dually equivalent to any class of finitary\nalgebras which is closed under taking subalgebras and Cartesian products.\nNotation. Given morphisms f;: X — Y; for i € {0,1}, the unique morphism induced by the universal\nproperty of the product is (fo, f1): X — Yo x Y,. Similarly, given morphisms g;: X; > Y with i € {0,1}, the\ncoproduct map is (°°) : Xo + X1 + Y. For infinite coproducts, we use the notation }?,-; X;. Epimorphisms\nare denoted by -», while monomorphisms (resp. regular monomorphisms) by — (resp. <>).

INTRODUCTION\n\nLet R be a commutative ring and let J C R be a finitely generated ideal. We\nwrite Y = V(J) C Spec(R) for the corresponding closed subset with quasi-compact\ncomplement. It is well-known that the I-adic completion Ry := lim, R/I” only\ndepends on Y. We sometimes write Ry, or just R, for this ring.\n\nIt is legitimate to ask whether the derived category D(R) of the completion\ncan be recovered from the derived category of R in purely tensor-triangular terms.\nThe question is tantalizing since the term ‘completion’ also refers to a standard\nconstruction in stable homotopy theory. Let us remind the reader.\n\nSuppose that J is a ‘big’ tensor-triangulated category. The exact hypothesis will\nplay an interesting role, so we give some details. We want the category J to be\ncompactly generated in the sense of Neeman [Nee01] and to admit a good notion of\n‘small’ object, namely, we want the compact objects J° and the dualizable objects T@\nto coincide: T° = J¢. There is a profusion of such ‘big’ tt-categories in mathematics,\nsee [BF11] or [HPS97]. The derived category J = D(R) is an example; its small\nobjects T° = T4 = DP? (R) are precisely the perfect complexes, i.e., the bounded\ncomplexes of finitely generated projective R-modules.\n\nFor any ‘big’ tt-category J, consider the spectrum Spc(J°) of the small part T°.\nChoose a closed subset Y C Spc(J°) with quasi-compact complement and let\n\nDate: 2024 November 21.\n2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 18F99.\nKey words and phrases.

A cohomological picture is then given.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe idea of working with Z2-graded real C*-algebras [18] as if they were complex ones first\nemerged in Kasparov’s founding paper [16] of bivariant K-theory. The trick merely consists of\n*complexifying” a given graded real C*-algebra; that is, considering the complex C*-algebra\nAc :=A ®p C together with the induced Z2-grading. The latter admits the obvious conjugate-\nlinear involution a @g A +> a @g A. Conversely, any Zo-graded complex C*-algebra B ad-\nmitting a conjugate linear involution o is necessarily the complexification of a graded real C*-\nalgebra Br, which identifies with the fixed points of o. It follows that *°complexification” defines\nan equivalence from the category of Z2-graded real C*-algebras to the category of Z2-graded\ncomplex C*-algebras endowed with conjugate-linear involutions (also called Real involutions\nor Real structures in the literature [16]). The inverse functor is ’realification’; that is, taking\nthe fixed point set of the involution. In fact, working with the complexified algebra instead of\nthe original real one is useful especially when it comes to discuss functional calculus. However,\nthat equivalence of categories no longer holds when the C*-algebras are acted upon by topolog-\nical groupoids endowed with Real structures [20]. By an action of a Real groupoid (G,T) ona\nZ-graded C*-algebra A equipped with a Real involution o we mean an action « = (&g)geg of\nG by *-automorphisms on A [17] such that for all g € G,a € Agig), rg) (o(a)) = o(x,(a)),\nand a, : As(g) —* Ar(g) iS an isomorphism of Zj-graded C*-algebras. The reason of such a\nfailure is that an action of G on Ag does not extends to an action of (S,T) on A satisfying the\ncondition mentioned above, unless the involution t : G§ —> G is trivial.\n\nIn the present paper, we are dealing with stable continuous-trace Z-graded C*-algebras\nA [22,26] endowed with Real involution and acted upon by a Real groupoid (5,7). Forget-\nting the involutions, it is known that [17,29] giving such C*-algebras is equivalent to giv-\n\ning Z2-graded Dixmier-Douady bundles A over G; that is, a Z2-graded elementary C*-bundle\n1",

The conjecture has many deep and important connections to\ngeometry, topology, representation theory and algebra. It is known to be true for large\nclasses of groups: see for example [30, 12, 35}.\n\nWork of Higson, Lafforgue and Skandalis [31] has, however, shown the conjecture to be\nfalse in the generality stated above. The counterexamples to the Baum-Connes conjecture\nthey discovered are closely connected to failures of exactness in the sense of Kirchberg and\nWassermann ( [6, Chapter 5]).

Recall the footstep of A-theory in the viewpoint of axiomatic\ncharacterization. The observation that the additivity theorem is the fundamental theorem of connec-\ntive algebraic K-theory is implicit in Waldhausen [Wal85] (See also [GSVW92]) and was known to\nGrayson [Gra87], Staffeldt [Sta89] and McCarthy [McC93]. Recently the connective K-theory is re-\ngarded as the universal additive invariant by Tabuada [Tab08] and Barwick [Bar14]. After Thomason\n[TT90], derived invariance and localizing properties of non-connective -theory are emphasized by\nmany authors [Nee92], [Kel99], [TV04], [Cis10], [BM11], [SchO6], [Sch11] and [Moc13]. In the\nlandscape of non-commutative motive theory [CT11] or motive theory for co-categories [BGT 13],\nnon-connective K-theory is the universal localizing invariant. To relate motivic homotopy theory\nwith motive theory for DG or co-categories, it is important to make clear that what additional axiom\nimplies the homotopy invariance property. Many authors have already defined and studied affine\nlines over certain categories as in [Alm74], [Alm78], [Gra77], [Haz83], [GM96], [Yao96] and [Sch06].\n(See also [Tab14]). The main objective in this paper is to examine the homotopy invariance of K-\ntheory for abelian categories by taking Schlichting polynomial categories. We recall the definition of\nthe polynomial categories. For a category C, we let EndC denote the category of endomorphisms\nin C. Namely, an object in EndC is a pair (x, ¢) consisting of an object « in C and a morphism\n@: a — x«inC and a morphism between (x,¢) > (y,w) is a morphism f : « — y in C such that\nwf = fo. (See Notation 2.1). From now on, let A be an abelian category. We write Lex A for\nthe category of left exact functors from A°? to Ab the category of abelian groups. The category\nLex A is a Grothendieck abelian category and the Yoneda embedding y : A — Lex A is exact and\nreflects exactness. We say an object x in A is noetherian if every ascending filtration of subobjects\nof x is stational. We say A is noetherian if every object in A is noetherian. (See Definition 2.4).\nWe assume that A is a noetherian abelian category and we write .A[t] for the full subcategory of\nnoetherian objects in End Lex A and call it the noetherian polynomial category over A. (See Defi-\nnition 2.18). We can prove that A[¢] is an abelian category. (See Lemma 2.5). For an object a in A,\n\nlet us define an object a[t](= (alt],t)) in End Lex A as follows. The underlying object a[t] is at’\nn=0\nwhere at’ is a copy of a. The endomorphism ¢ : at] > alt] is defined by the identity morphisms\nat’ — at't' in each components. We can prove that if a is noetherian in .A, then a[t] is noetherian in\nAlt]. (See Theorem 2.17). We call the association — ®,4 Z[t] : A > Alt], a alt] the base change\nfunctor which is an exact functor. One of the consequence of the main theorem is the following:",

For\nthe case of maps between proper metric spaces, we exhibit some connections between the coarse\nand classical notions of monotone and light using the Higson corona. Finally, we look at some\ncoarse properties which are preserved by coarsely light maps such as finite asymptotic dimension\nand exactness, and make some remarks on the situation for groups and group homomorphisms.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nRecall that continuous map from a compact Hausdorff space X to a compact Hausdorff space\nY is called monotone if it is surjective and each of its fibres is connected, and is called light if\neach of its fibres is totally disconnected (see for example [25]). Eilenberg showed in [16] that every\ncontinuous map f between compact metric spaces factorizes as f = me, where m is light and e is\nmonotone (in fact, the result holds more generally for compact Hausdorff spaces, see [7]). Moreover,\nthis factorization satisfies a universal property, namely that for any commutative diagram\n\ne m\neo ——— e ———-_ 8\n\nwhere the arrows are continuous maps and the objects are compact Hausdorff spaces, with e’\nmonotone and m’ light, there is a unique continuous map h making the diagram commute:\n\nIn the language of category theory, this is to say that the classes of monotone maps and light\nmaps constitute a factorization system [17] on the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and\ncontinuous maps.\n\nIn coarse geometry one is interested in the large scale properties of metric (or more general)\nspaces, or in other words, properties of spaces “as viewed from a great distance” [20]. For example,\nthe metric spaces R and Z are “coarsely equivalent”, that is, isomorphic in the coarse category,\n\nDate: August 24, 2016.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 51F99, 18B30, 54C10, 54F45.\n\n1",

Given a graded-commutative ring acting centrally on a triangulated cate-\ngory, our main result shows that if cohomology of a pair of objects of the triangulated\ncategory is finitely generated over the ring acting centrally, then the asymptotic vanish-\ning of the cohomology is well-behaved. In particular, enough consecutive asymptotic\nvanishing of cohomology implies all eventual vanishing. Several key applications are\nalso given.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe vanishing of homology and cohomology is a basic consideration in algebra. There\nhave been many recent accounts of asymptotic vanishing of homology over certain com-\nmutative rings in the literature, essentially beginning with [3]; see also [31], [30], [26],\n[29], [27], [13], [18], [11], [21], [20]. Several recent articles have turned to investiga-\ntions of asymptotic vanishing of cohomology [28], [9], [10], [19]. A common thread to\nthese articles is that they have made some appeals to a Noetherian condition on the\ntotality of cohomology. In this paper we distill these concepts into the context of trian-\ngulated categories, where cohomology — unlike homology — is naturally defined, and\nplays a prominant role. We show that if the triangulated category admits a central ring\naction over which the cohomology is Noetherian, then asymptotic vanishing is rather\nwell-behaved, in the sense that sporadic vanishing cannot occur. Specifically, our main\nresult is the following.\n\nTheorem 1. Let (@,%,A) be a triangulated category with a central ring action from a\ngraded-commutative Noetherian ring H*, and A,B € @ two objects such that the H*-\nmodule Hom?\" (A, B) is finitely generated.

We also prove similar results for Tate cohomology\nrings over commutative local Gorenstein rings.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nLet 7 be an n-Calabi-Yau triangulated category, and X an object in J. We\ninvestigate the structure of the Z-graded cohomology ring\n\nHom*(X,X) = Giez Homz(X, 5D! X).\n\nOne of our main results states that when the subalgebra @;59 Hom7(X,D' X)\npossesses a regular sequence of length 2 of central elements of positive degree,\nthen n < —1 and most products in negative degree are trivial. More precisely, if\nx,y € Hom7(X, X) with |a| <n and |y| < 0, then xy = 0. In particular, when\nn = —1, which is a common case in applications, then one can remove the word\n“most” from the previous sentence, and in fact, the cohomology in negative degree\nis a trivial extension of the cohomology ring in non-negative degree.\n\nThe main situation to which our results apply is when 7 is the stable module\ncategory of a finite dimensional symmetric algebra A over a field. Here our results\ntranslate to the Tate cohomology ring Ext, (M ,M) of a finitely generated (left) A-\nmodule M having trivial products in negative degree. As a special case we recover\na result of Benson and Carlson [BenCa] on the Tate cohomology ring Extyg(k, k),\nfor G a finite group whose order is divisible by the characteristic of the ground field\nk. Indeed, their paper served as a major inspiration for the present one. Another\ncorollary is that the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring HH (A) of a symmetric al-\ngebra A, defined in [BerJo], has trivial products in negative degree. We also give\nvarious results on the structure of the cohomology rings when @;>9 Hom7(X, D' X)\nis only assumed to admit a single central regular element of positive degree.\n\nIn Section 2 we derive properties in the abstract for products in Z-graded asso-\nciative algebras which possess a natural duality.

INTRODUCTION\n\nUniversal Coefficient Theorems in algebraic topology establish a connection between ordinary homology (resp.\ncohomology) with homology (resp. cohomology) with coefficients. In noncommutative geometry, C*-algebras\nare viewed as noncommutative analogues of topological spaces and as such it is reasonable to extend ideas\nfrom algebraic topology to a noncommutative framework. In this sense, K-theory of C*-algebras is viewed as\na homology theory for C*-algebras, which provides important invariants for C*-algebras (e.g. AF-algebras are\ncompletely classified through K-theory [9]). Dually, K-homology for C*-algebras is a cohomology theory for\nC*-algebras, which agrees with the Ext-functor in the commutative unital case. K-theory and K-homology can\nbe related to each other by means of the index theory of elliptic pseudo-differential operators (e.g. the Atiyah-\nSinger’s theorem). Kasparov KK-theory is in turn a bivariant K-theory, which gathers together both K-theory\nand K-homology of C*-algebras. KK-theory plays a central role in the classification program of C*-algebras, but\nit is also relevant to approach diverse problems outside noncommutative geometry, e.g. the Novikov conjecture.\n\nThe Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT for short) of J. Rosenberg and C. Schochet [26] approximates the\nbivariant K-theory of Kasparov in terms of ordinary K-theory. More precisely, given two (separable) C*-algebras\nA and B, there exists a short exact sequence:\n\nExtz(K,(A), Kx(B)) — KK(A, B) - Hom(K,(A), K,(B)),\n\n*Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen (Denmark).

Projectivity and injectivity are fundamental notions in category\ntheory. We consider natural weakenings termed semiprojectivity and semiin-\njectivity, and study these concepts in different categories.\n\nFor example, in the category of metric spaces, (semi)injective objects are\nprecisely the absolute (neighborhood) retracts. We show that the trivial group\nis the only semiinjective group, while every free product of a finitely presented\ngroup and a free group is semiprojective.\n\nTo a compact, metric space X we associate the commutative C*-algebra\nC(X). This association is contravariant, whence semiinjectivity of X is related\nto semiprojectivity of C(X). Together with Adam S¢rensen, we showed that\nC(X) is semiprojective in the category of all C*-algebras if and only if X is\nan absolute neighborhood retract with dim(X) < 1.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nWhile being fundamental in category theory, the concepts of projectivity and\ninjectivity are often very restrictive. It is therefore natural to consider weaker\nversions of these notions.\n\nFor example, injective objects in the category of metric spaces and continuous\nmaps are precisely the absolute retracts introduced by Borsuk in 1931. He also\ndefined a generalization, called absolute neighborhood retracts; see Definition 3.10.\nTherefore, being an absolute neighborhood retract is a weak form of injectivity\nin the category of metric spaces. While not many spaces are absolute retracts,\nnumerous naturally occurring spaces are absolute neighborhood retracts, including\ntopological manifolds, polyhedra and CW-complexes.\n\nGiven a compact, metric space X, we associate the algebra C(X) of continuous\ncomplex-valued functions on X. This is a C*-algebra with the supremum norm and\npointwise operations. The category CMetr of compact, metric spaces, and the cat-\negory AbSC? of abelian, unital, separable C*-algebras are (contravariantly) equiv-\nalent. We therefore think of C*-algebras as ‘noncommutative topological spaces’.\n\nUsing the contravariant correspondence between CMetr and AbSC7}, injectivity\nof a compact, metric space X corresponds precisely to projectivity of C(X) in the\ncategory AbSC}. However, projectivity within the category Cj of unital C*-\nalgebras and unital *-homomorphisms is more restrictive - since there are more\nlifting problems to be solved.\n\nDate: September 19, 2018.\n\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

For example the original author name might have only the first letter capitalized, but the model returns the name with all letters capitalized. In this experiment, such adjustment is still considered wrong, because the purpose of this experiment is to examine the model's capability in correctly extracting information. Any alternation in the information might have adverse effect, despite that such slight change might not be as disastrous as one thinks. Fine-tuning the model and prompt engineering might improve the result."
